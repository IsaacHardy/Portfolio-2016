<h3 class="mytabtitle">BIO</h3>
<h4 class="mytabsubtitle">ABOUT ME</h4>
<p>I'm <strong>Isaac</strong>, a Front End Developer and Designer who enjoys the thrills of learning, who marvels in the ways of creativity, and who stands firm in the failures of everyday life. I strive to be a developer with high standards in quality web-design and humility.</p>
<p>When not solving syntax errors, you'll find me watching Netflix with my wife, gaming, or getting hugs from my daughter.</p>
<h3 class="mytabtitle">HOBBIES</h3>
<h4 class="mytabsubtitle">INTERESTS</h4>
<p>GAMING: Love playing anything made by Blizzard, Bethesda, and/or Bungie. The three B's! Lover of all the Zelda games, too.</p>
<p>MUSIC: I play guitar, piano, and sing! (Didn't say I was good at them) Music has always been a great medium for me to express myself and is an art that demands both disciple and beauty.</p>
<p>SPORTS: I'm a sports watcher and really enjoy staying active through; biking, jogging, softball, golf, and weightlifting (Yes bro, I do lift).</p>
<p>READING: Love reading fantasy novels (e.g. Lord of the Rings, Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, King Killer Chronicles). I also enjoy reading the Bible and books based on Biblical teachings.</p>
<h3 class="mytabtitle">CAUSES</h3>
<h4 class="mytabsubtitle">CAUSES I CARE ABOUT</h4>
<p>POVERTY: One billion people on this planet are currently malnutritious.</p>
<p>YOUTH: As a teenager, I lost a mentor and friend; my older brother. I now desire to help teenagers love their uniqueness and love others through volunteering and mentoring.</p>
<p>LIFE: I believe all human beings are valuable, from conception unto eternity.</p>
<p>EDUCATION: Knowledge is a tool that each individual should have access. </p>
<h3 class="mytabtitle">VOLUNTEER</h3>
<h4 class="mytabsubtitle">VOLUNTEER WORK</h4>
